.. _edit action:

edit
=====

The ``edit`` action changes some specific attributes on the pull request.
The ``draft`` parameter converts the pull request to a draft or the other way
around according to a boolean defined. The draft state avoids pinging 
reviewers too early and until the pull request is ready to be merged.

Examples

ðŸ“œ Converting a Pull Request to a Draft on Check Failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If any of your continuous integration checks fails, it might be worth converting
the pull request to a draft automatically since it's likely that it's not ready for review.
